# 🧠 Amygdata PHQ-9 Risk Score  
### Predicting Depression Severity with a Scalable Analytics Pipeline  
*Python • SQL • PySpark • Linear Regression • Mental Health Analytics*

---

## 📌 Overview  
**Amygdata PHQ-9 Risk Score** is an end-to-end data analytics and machine learning project designed to predict *depression severity* based on PHQ-9 scores (0–27).

This project demonstrates the ability to work across three analytical layers:

- **SQL** — data exploration and feature understanding  
- **Python + Pandas** — exploratory data analysis and baseline modelling  
- **PySpark (Spark MLlib)** — scalable, production-like ML pipeline  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  

- Build a **regression model** that predicts PHQ-9 depression severity.  
- Compare a baseline *scikit-learn Linear Regression* model with a *Spark ML pipeline*.  
- Demonstrate SQL-based feature exploration and profiling.  
- Provide a reproducible, modular codebase that reflects real-world analytical processes.
